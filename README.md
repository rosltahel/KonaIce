## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

You need to run a local server to view the project properly because browsers block local file access for images and scripts.

If you have Python installed:

```bash
# For Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser and open `index.html`.

### Option 2: VS Code Live Server

If you're using VS Code:
